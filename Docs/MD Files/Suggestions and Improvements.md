# Suggestions & Improvements

## 1. Timestamps and Auditing
- Add `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt` to more tables (e.g., SalesOrderItems, Invoices, Employees)
- Consider an `AuditLog` table for system-wide changes (UserId, Table, Action, Timestamp)

## 2. Enum Storage
- For fields like `DeliveryStatus`, consider whether you'll store them as strings, ints, or separate lookup tables
- A `LookupValues` table might help if you want easy extensibility

## 3. Soft Deletes
- Add `IsDeleted` or `DeletedAt` for entities where historical data matters (e.g., Users, Products, Employees)

## 4. Indexing & Performance
- Add indexes to foreign keys (`UserId`, `ProductId`, etc.) and common query fields (`Email`, `SKU`, `OrderNumber`) for performance

## 5. Product Pricing History
Consider a `ProductPrices` table to track price changes over time:

```sql
ProductPrices (
  Id (PK)
  ProductId (FK)
  Price
  EffectiveFrom
  EffectiveTo (nullable)
)
```

## 6. Multi-Tenancy (if applicable)
- If you're targeting SaaS or multiple companies, add `CompanyId` to key tables and isolate data

## 7. Bulk Import & Integration Hooks
- Tables for `ImportLogs`, `ExternalIntegrations`, or webhook endpoints could add flexibility for real-world usage

## 8. More Granular Payroll
- Maybe split salary components like Allowances, Taxes, Overtime into another table for better breakdown
